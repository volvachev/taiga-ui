            In user interface design for computer applications, a modal window
            is a graphical control element subordinate to an application's main
            window. A modal window creates a mode that disables the main window
            but keeps it visible, with the modal window as a child window in
            front of it. Users must interact with the modal window before they
            can return to the parent application. This avoids interrupting the
            workflow on the main window. Modal windows are sometimes called
            heavy windows or modal dialogs because they often display a dialog
            box.
